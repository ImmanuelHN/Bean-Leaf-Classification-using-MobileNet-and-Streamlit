I have used Bean Leaf dataset from Kaggle "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/therealoise/bean-disease-dataset". 
The goal of this project is to assess the ability to apply transfer learning to a real-world agricultural problem. 
I have loaded a dataset of bean leaf images, preprocess them, apply a pre-trained MobileNet model, and deploy my solution in a user-friendly application using streamlit to assist farmers.
